🎯 **Data Engineer** | 🛠 AWS Enthusiast | 🧠 Forever Learning

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a curious problem solver who transitioned from Software Development to Data Engineering. I enjoy building clean, scalable pipelines and automating the boring stuff — responsibly.

## 🌍 What I do

- 🍰 Bake data pipelines using **Python**, **Poetry**, **SQL**, and **AWS Glue**
- 🚀 Launch solutions with **Lambda**, **S3**, **Athena**, and **Terragrunt**
- 🧹 Clean and simple Dockerfiles, even when `id_ed25519` gets feisty
- 📦 Obsessed with dependency management (yep, including `pyproject.toml`)
- 📊 Turn chaos into insight with well-structured, monitored pipelines

## 🔒 Sorry, the best work is private

While my current projects are locked behind 🔐, here’s what I can say:

> 💡 “If you’ve ever debugged a handler chain tangled in `poetry.lock`, we might have worked together.”

- I’ve contributed to scalable internal libraries
- I love clean logs, solid versioning (`x.y.z` forever!), and testing code that talks to AWS
- My changelogs actually change things™

## 📫 Let’s connect

- 🧙‍♀️ Fun fact: I speak Simlish (ask me why)

🛠 Always tweaking. Always learning. This README will probably get better after I hit "commit".
